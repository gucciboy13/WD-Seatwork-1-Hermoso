## 📌 Sections Overview

Each section (`box1` to `box5`) follows a consistent structure:

- **Header** – Displays a logo and name (Anthony Gabrielle Hermoso)
- **Info** – Shows course and activity identifiers (TC05, WD-SEATWORK1)
- **Navbar** – Simple navigation links with hover effects
- **Footer** – "All Rights Reserved 2025" text

Each box is styled differently using CSS classes:
- `box1` – Basic with border
- `box2` – Gradient background
- `box3` – Light yellow with drop shadow
- `box4` – Info-style background with accent border
- `box5` – Alert-style with monospace font
