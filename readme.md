Overview

This project showcases five distinct section styles (boxes) implemented within a single HTML page, each demonstrating different design themes and interactive elements. It is a web layout exercise named **TC05 Sections**, created as a seatwork assignment to practice CSS styling techniques and basic HTML structure.

Guiding Questions:

- **What is the project?**  
  A single HTML page with multiple visually unique section styles that display header, navigation, info, and footer elements.

- **What is the purpose?**  
  To demonstrate mastery of CSS styling (including animations, gradients, flexbox, grid layouts, and hover effects) alongside semantic HTML structure, and to present information in an organized and visually appealing way.

  Five styled boxes (sections) each with:  
  - Header (with logo and name)  
  - Information area  
  - Navigation bar with links and inputs/selects/buttons  
  - Footer with copyright notice

## Rules, Practices and Principles

- Project titles should use the prefix `WD-` followed by a descriptive name for the subject.  
- Filename for the main HTML page must always be `index.html`.  
- Files must be organized into respective folders (assets, css, img, js).  
- Naming conventions follow camelCase format (e.g., `buttonAnimatedStyle.css`).  
- Use **only external CSS** files for styling.  
- Folder names should be descriptive and related to their content or function.
