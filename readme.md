## Overview

This project showcases five distinct section styles (boxes) implemented within a single HTML page, each demonstrating different design themes and interactive elements. It is a web layout exercise named **TC05 Sections**, created as a seatwork assignment to practice CSS styling techniques and basic HTML structure.

### Guiding Questions:

- **What is the project?**  
  A single HTML page with multiple visually unique section styles that display header, navigation, info, and footer elements.

- **What is the purpose?**  
  To demonstrate mastery of CSS styling (including animations, gradients, flexbox, grid layouts, and hover effects) alongside semantic HTML structure, and to present information in an organized and visually appealing way.

- **What are the key components?**  
  Five styled boxes (sections) each with:  
  - Header (with logo and name)  
  - Information area  
  - Navigation bar with links and inputs/selects/buttons  
  - Footer with copyright notice

- **What technology is used and how?**  
  Pure **HTML** and **CSS** (no JavaScript). CSS features include animations, flexbox, grid layout, gradients, and hover effects to create dynamic and modern UI components.

## Rules, Practices and Principles

- Project titles should use the prefix `WD-` followed by a descriptive name for the subject.  
- Filename for the main HTML page must always be `index.html`.  
- Files must be organized into respective folders (assets, css, img, js).  
- Naming conventions follow camelCase format (e.g., `buttonAnimatedStyle.css`).  
- Use **only external CSS** files for styling.  
- Folder names should be descriptive and related to their content or function.  

### Example file structure:

```
WD-TC05Sections
├─ assets
│ ├─ css
│ │ └─ style.css
│ ├─ img
│ │ └─ logo.png
│ └─ js
│ └─ script.js
├─ pages
│ └─ pageName
│ ├─ assets
│ │ ├─ css
│ │ │ └─ style.css
│ │ ├─ img
│ │ │ └─ image.png
│ │ └─ js
│ │ └─ script.js
│ └─ index.html
├─ index.html
└─ readme.md
```
