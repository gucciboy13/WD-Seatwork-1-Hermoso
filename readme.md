## Rules, Practices and Principles  

- ✅ Always use **WD-** prefix in the project title (e.g., `WD-SEATWORK1`)  
- ✅ Do not rename `index.html`  
- ✅ Store files in their respective folders: `assets/css`, `assets/js`, etc.  
- ✅ Use **camelCase** for all file names  
  - Example: `buttonAnimatedStyle.css`  
- ✅ Only external CSS is used  
- ✅ Rename folders inside `pages/` clearly to match their purpose  
- ✅ File Structure:

│ │ └── logo.png
│ └── js
│ └── script.js
